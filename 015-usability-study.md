# Day 15 - Usability Study

## Usability Study

> A research method that assesses how easy it is for users to complete core tasks in a design
> The goal is to identify pain points that the user experiences with the design so the issues can be fixed before the final product launches.

## Moderated Usability Study

> A moderator guides participants through the study in real time

## Unmoderated Usability Study

> Participants test out the prototypes without human guidance
