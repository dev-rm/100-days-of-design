## Information Architecture (IA)

- Outline of the information of an app or a website
- or organization of content in a website

## Key elements of Cognitive Pyschology (how human minds work) relevant to IA design

- ### Gestalt principles

  - >explore usersâ€™ visual perception of objects in relation to each other, including similarity, continuity, proximity, symmetry, and closure

- ### Mental models

  - >assumptions people have in their minds before they interact with the product

- ### Cognitive load

  - >amount of brainpower that user has to invest in interacting with a product

## Types of organization systems

1.Hierarchical

- create one index page with links to other pages.

2.Sequential

- the users have to follow a sequence to get the desired task done.

3.Matrix

- the user gets to decide the navigation way. It could be according to date or along the topic.
