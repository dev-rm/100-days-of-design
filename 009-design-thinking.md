# Day 9 - Design Thinking

## Design Thinking

> Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test

## Five phases of design thinking

### 1. Empathize

- empathizing with the user is the first step to understand the user's true needs and gain insights while setting aside all the assumptions. It involves researching the needs of the users. <br>
**Things to do**:

  - Build an **Empathy Map** (one user or aggregated) - includes what the user says, thinks, does, feels, e.t.c
  - Identify **user pain points** - pain points could be financial, product-related, process-related, or support-related
  - Build **personas** - on the basis of user groups (a set of people with similar interests, goals, or concerns)

### 2. Define

- defining the problems identified by analyzing the information gathered in the Empathize stage. <br>
**Things to do**: <br>
  - Define **problem statement** based on the personas (clear description of user's needs that should be addressed) - a problem statement should be human-centered, broad enough for creative freedom, and narrow enough to be solved by design.<br>

#### Formula for problem statement (from user research perspective)

User name **is a** user characteristics **who needs** user needs **because** insight <br>

>5 Ws Framework can be used to build a problem statement:

- >Who is experiencing the problem? Knowing the user and their background is important.
- >What are the pain points that you're trying to alleviate? Determining those early on in the process helps in answering rest of these questions.
- >Where is the user when they're using the product? The physical context of a user is important to your design.
- >When does the problem occur in the user journey?
- >Why is the problem important? How is it affecting the user?

- Create **user stories**  
- > A user story is a fictional one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions
- Create **user journey map**  
- >A user journey is a series of experiences a user has as they interact with the product

### 3.Ideate

- generating ideas on a given topic without evaluating them. <br>
**Things to do**:
  - **Competive audit** - competitor analysis (Refer to References [#4](<https://usabilitygeek.com/how-to-do-ux-competitor-analysis/>))
  - **How Might We (HMW)...? questions** - suggests that a solution is possible but doesn't give any hints as to what that solution might be.
  - **Crazy Eights** - generate eight ideas in eight minutes (one minute for each idea)

### 4.Prototype - create low fidelity wireframes and high fidelity prototypes

### 5. Test
