## 5 Quality components of usability

1. Learnability - how easy is it for the users to perform the basic tasks first time they encounter the design
2. Efficiency - how long does it take for the users to perform those tasks once they have learned the design?
3. Memorability - How easily can the users recall how to perform those tasks when they return to the design after a duration of not using it?
4. Errors - How many errors do users make? Are they severe? How easily can they recover from those errors?
5. Satisfaction - Do users feel nice about using the design?
