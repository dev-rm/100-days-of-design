# Day 17 - Spatial Memory in UX Design

> Spatial memory is the ability to learn the location of the object of interest by interacting with them repeatedly.

- In GUIs, it helps users develop a level of automaticity(without occupying mind with low level of details)  when accessing frequently used features or data

For eg. a MacOS user will look for the close(X) button on the top-left hand side of the screen while the Windows or PC user will look for the close(X) button on the right hand of the screen.
